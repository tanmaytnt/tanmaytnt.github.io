			<p>The first personality test i took was the myers briggs personlity test.</p>
			
			
			<p>The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and preferences.</p>
            <p>The test results showed me that i have a <mark>MEDIATOR</mark>personality.</p>
			<p>, Mediators have vibrant and passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity â€“ Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.</p>

						<p>The second test i took was an online learning style test.</p>
						<p>The results of this showed me that im a Tactile/Kinesthetic Learner</p>
						<p>tactile/Kinesthetic learners learn best when they can use their sense of touch and can move about. If you are a tactile/kinesthetic learner, the suggestions that follow can help you to succeed in school to the best of your ability.</p>
						<p>Suggestions for a tactile/kinesthetic learner:</p>
						<ul>
							<il>be physically active while you study. Rather than just sit at your desk, occasionally walk back and forth with your textbook or notes as you read the information out loud.</il>
							<il>to decrease your fidgeting as you study, listen to music, preferably baroque music. However, discontinue this if you find the music to be distracting.</il>
							<il>Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet. Actively touching the keyboard will keep your mind active.</il>
						</ul>
