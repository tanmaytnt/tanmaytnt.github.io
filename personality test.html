			<p>The first personality test i took was the myers briggs personlity test.</p>
			
			
			<p>The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator is a self-report inventory designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and preferences.</p>
            <p>The test results showed me that i have a <mark>MEDIATOR</mark>personality.</p>
			<p>, Mediators have vibrant and passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity â€“ Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.</p>
