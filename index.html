			<p>Hey, i am tanmay jain, an earnest student of the Royal melbourne institute of technology.</p>

					<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
					<p>I have graduated from amity interantional school noida.I took science as my major subjects and also an additional subject of computer science.</p>
					<p>I have already learned languages such as python and a little bit of C++ which i learned on my own.</p>

					<h3>NFT DEVELOPER</h3>
					<p>I've taught at different levels of education.</br>
					Younger primary school students in after school coding programs through Invent the World.</br>
					University level education ranging from 1st year to Post Grad students through RMIT on campus and online via Open University Australia</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<p>While there I don't have formal education in philosophy it is very much an interest of mine.</p>
					<p>Always interested in reading and learning more! I can not recommend having another interest enough outside of Information Technology. Such development and passion in other areas can only benefit you more.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
